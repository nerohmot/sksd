# The `enable` keyword will determine if the Spyder Kernels Daemon will start
#
# Notes:
#  * if `enable` is supplied, it is presumed turned off!
#  * if `enable` can not be interpreted, it is presumed turned off!

# The `name` is the 'pretty print' (host)name that will be published.
# spaces, apostrops are allowed, it is a string!
# if `service_name` is not provided here, the system's hostname (not so pretty)
# will be pasted in.
#
# Notes:
#  * if no service `name` is provided, the service will not start!
#
# Type = (unicode) string

# The `description` is the (multi-line) description of the `service`.
# This is basically for those who are not intimately familiar with the box.

# Type = list of (unicode) string(s)

# The `guest_account` keyword determines as what `user` the sksd
# will spin up the Spyder Kernels.
#
# If there is no `guest_account`, this means that the user needs to provide
# valid credentials for this host system.
#
# Notes:
#  * a `guest_account` can hold a "user" string, which means that the supplied
#    user doesn't need a password.
#  * a `guest_account` can hold a "user:passwd" string, which means that the
#    supplied user needs a password, and that the password is 'passwd'.
#  * if no `guest_account` is proveded (or is empty), the service is **only**
#    available through the normal username/password credentials.
#
# Type = (unicode) string
#
# Default value = ""
#
guest_account = anonymous:anonymous

##############################################################################
# The `guest_can_manage_environments` keyword determines if a `guest`
# is allowed to create/modify (guest) environments.
#
# Notes:
#  * if no guest_account is provided, this option is disregarded.
#  * a `user` (guest or not) can in any case not create/modify environments
#    outside the scope of the user !
#
# Type = boolean

# Default = True

guest_can_manage_environments = Yup

##############################################################################
# The `max_kernels` keyword determines the maximum number of spyder-kernels
# `skd` can spinn up. This is a (posetive) integer value. If the value can't
# be interpreted, the fallback is '0'. '0' means automatic calculation, it
# takes the number of CPU cores, deducts 1 and that is set. There is in principle
# no upper limit ...
#
# Notes:
#  * `skd` will publish the value for `max_kernels` as well as the number of
#    kernels already spinned up.
#  * AUTO means # CPU cores - 1
#  * CORES = the number of CPU cores
#  * simple calculations are possible the result will be casted to integer.
#    (iow rounded down) eg: (CORES/2)-1 ➜ (8/2)-1 ➜ 3 for a 8 core machine.
#
# Type = integer
#
# Default = 'AUTO' = CORES - 1
#

##############################################################################
# The `exclude_environments` keyword determines what environments will **NOT**
# be published. (regardless if they exist or not)
#
# Notes:
#  * It **must** be a list
#  * One can use a wildcard '*' in the list.
#  * applictaion environments (starting with '_') can also be excluded here.
#  * If nothing is provided the default is presumed.
#
# Type = list of (unicode) strings
